# Behaviour_Editor
First attempt at C# Windows Form Application. Used to edit behaviour XML files for background AIs.

Alot of comment-out code from when I was trying it out with Microsoft's examples.

### TODO:

- [ ] Load data from Objects.xml
- [ ] Create text boxes that outputs loaded data from Objects.xml
- [ ] Create list of objects
- [ ] Feature file save

- [ ] Actually learn XML
